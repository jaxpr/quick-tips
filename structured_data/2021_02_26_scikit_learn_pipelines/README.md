# Tabular data: Scikit-learn Pipelines and LightGBM

When working on a data science problem you are faced with multiple challenges. How to preprocess my data in a structured way? How to avoid dataset leakage? How to efficiently do hyper parameter tuning?

Scikit-learn has the solution to these problems! In this notebook we will show you how to approach a tabular data project using scikit-learn pipelines and how it integrates with a SOTA model like LightGBM.

Open the notebook in Colab to learn how apply these best practices on the famous titanic dataset:
