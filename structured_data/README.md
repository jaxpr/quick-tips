- [_Time Series: Getting Started_ (08/02/2021)](2021_02_08_timeseries_getting_started):
This notebook contains some sample code to turn your tabular dataset into a time series dataset and run an exploratory analysis.
- [_Tabular Data: scikit-learn pipelines & LightGBM_ (26/02/2021)](2021_02_26_scikit_learn_pipelines):
This notebook contains the famous [titanic problem](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) which we solve using scikit-learn pipelines in combination with LightGBM: a state of the art gradient boosting machine.
- [_Time Series: MINIROCKET classifier_ (04/06/2021)](2021_06_04_minirocket_timeseries_classification):
This notebook provides looks into how MINIROCKET — a novel feature extraction for time series classification — compares to feature extraction using tsfresh and Fourier transformation in terms of speed, performance, and explainabillity.
- [_Time Series: Labeling tools_ (07/06/2021)](2021_06_07_timeseries_labeling_tools):
This document contains an overview of the currently available labeling tools for time series. What tools are the ones to be used, which ones you probably better avoid.
- [_Tabular Data: Tensorflow Data Validation_ (30/06/2021)](2021_06_30_tensorflow_data_validation):
This notebook showcases the functionality of TensorFlow Data Validation (TFDV), a tool developed by tensorflow
to track anomalous changes in your data.
- [_Tabular Data: Serving decision forests with Tensorflow Serving_ (02/07/2021)](2021_07_02_TFDF_serving):
  This Readme documents the use of our custom TF Serving docker image built to serve Tensorflow Decision Forests.
