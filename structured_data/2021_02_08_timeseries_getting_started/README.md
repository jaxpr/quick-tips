# Time series: Getting started

Getting started with a time series project can be overwhelming.
What do you do with missing values? How should you (re)sample your dataset? What about stationarity checks and season-trend-lag (STL) decomposition? How do you detect outliers? How do you get started with forecasting?

This tip includes a modified version of the [fatal police shootings dataset](https://data.world/data-society/fatal-police-shootings) to illustrate some common problems with time series datasets.

Open the notebook in Colab to learn how to get started making a forecast of the number of fatal police shootings in the USA:
